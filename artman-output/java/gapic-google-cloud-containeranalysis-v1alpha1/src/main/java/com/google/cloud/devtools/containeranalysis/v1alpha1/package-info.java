/**
 * A client to Container Analysis API.
 *
 * <p>The interfaces provided are listed below, along with usage samples.
 *
 * <p>======================= ContainerAnalysisClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: Retrieves the results of vulnerability scanning of cloud components such
 * as container images. The Container Analysis API is an implementation of the [Grafeas](grafeas.io)
 * API.
 *
 * <p>The vulnerability results are stored as a series of Occurrences. An `Occurrence` contains
 * information about a specific vulnerability in a resource. An `Occurrence` references a `Note`. A
 * `Note` contains details about the vulnerability and is stored in a stored in a separate project.
 * Multiple `Occurrences` can reference the same `Note`. For example, an SSL vulnerability could
 * affect multiple packages in an image. In this case, there would be one `Note` for the
 * vulnerability and an `Occurrence` for each package with the vulnerability referencing that
 * `Note`.
 *
 * <p>Sample for ContainerAnalysisClient:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * try (ContainerAnalysisClient containerAnalysisClient = ContainerAnalysisClient.create()) {
 *   String formattedName = ContainerAnalysisClient.formatOccurrenceName("[PROJECT]", "[OCCURRENCE]");
 *   Occurrence response = containerAnalysisClient.getOccurrence(formattedName);
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
