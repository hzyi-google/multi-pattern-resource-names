        # Cloud Security Command Center's (Cloud SCC) finding source. A finding source
        # is an entity or a mechanism that can produce a finding. A source is like a
        # container of findings that come from the same scanner, logger, monitor, etc.
        # @!attribute [rw] name
        #   @return [String]
        #     The relative resource name of this source. See:
        #     https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name
        #     Example:
        #     "organizations/123/sources/456"
        # @!attribute [rw] display_name
        #   @return [String]
        #     The source's display name.
        #     A source's display name must be unique amongst its siblings, for example,
        #     two sources with the same parent can't share the same display name.
        #     The display name must start and end with a letter or digit, may contain
        #     letters, digits, spaces, hyphens, and underscores, and can be no longer
        #     than 32 characters. This is captured by the regular expression:
        #     [\p{L}\p{N}](https://cloud.google.com{\p{L}\p{N}_- ]{0,30}[\p{L}\p{N}])?.
        # @!attribute [rw] description
        #   @return [String]
        #     The description of the source (max of 1024 characters).
        #     Example:
        #     "Cloud Security Scanner is a web security scanner for common
        #     vulnerabilities in App Engine applications. It can automatically
        #     scan and detect four common vulnerabilities, including cross-site-scripting
        #     (XSS), Flash injection, mixed content (HTTP in HTTPS), and
        #     outdated/insecure libraries."
